# Session Handover - January 3, 2025

## Project Status
- **Simplified VPN Manager** - 6 core components (~2,800 lines)
- **Branch**: master (only branch, simplified version)
- **Philosophy**: Option A - Maintenance only (no features)
- **Issues**: 19 open (#58-#77), all labeled "option-a"

## Completed This Session
✅ Audited all 44 GitHub issues for relevance
✅ Closed Issue #43 (Option B enhancements - conflicted with philosophy)
✅ Confirmed all 19 remaining issues are maintenance/security focused
✅ Identified P0 critical security issues for immediate action

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### P0 - MUST FIX (Security & Blockers)
1. **Issue #61**: Create functional installation process
   - Current installers are broken/enterprise-focused
   - Blocks new user adoption
   - Need simple install.sh script

2. **Issue #58**: Secure credential storage (CVSS 7.5)
   - Credentials currently in project root
   - Move to ~/.config/vpn/ with 600 permissions

3. **Issue #59**: Fix world-writable log files (CVSS 7.2)
   - Logs have 666 permissions (security risk)
   - Fix to 644, move to ~/.local/state/vpn/

4. **Issue #60**: Add race condition test coverage
   - Issue #46 fix has ZERO tests (TDD violation)
   - Need TOCTOU tests for lock file handling

## Recommended Starting Point

**Start with Issue #61 (Installation)** - It's the biggest blocker and relatively straightforward:
- Delete old enterprise installers
- Create simple install.sh
- Copy 6 components to /usr/local/bin
- Set up config directories
- ~8 hours effort

## Next Session Prompt

```
I need to work on the simplified VPN manager project. We've completed the restructuring from enterprise to simple (6 components, ~2800 lines).

Current status:
- Only master branch exists (simplified version)
- 19 open issues (#58-#77), all "option-a" maintenance
- Following "do one thing right" philosophy
- No feature additions, only bugs/security fixes

Please start with Issue #61: Create functional installation process. The current installers are enterprise-focused and broken. We need a simple install.sh that:
1. Copies 6 core components to /usr/local/bin
2. Creates ~/.config/vpn/ for configs
3. Sets proper permissions
4. No systemd/runit services (not needed)

After that, tackle the P0 security issues (#58, #59, #60) in order.

The project philosophy is in CLAUDE.md - maintain simplicity, no enterprise features.
```

## Important Context
- **6 Core Components**: vpn, vpn-manager, vpn-connector, best-vpn-profile, vpn-error-handler, fix-ovpn-configs
- **No Enterprise Features**: No APIs, dashboards, complex configs, background services
- **Simple File Storage**: No databases, just text files
- **Option A Only**: Maintenance, bugs, security - no enhancements

## Files to Reference
- `/home/mqx/workspace/claude-code/vpn/CLAUDE.md` - Project philosophy
- `/home/mqx/workspace/claude-code/vpn/docs/implementation/SIMPLIFICATION_HISTORY.md` - Why simplified
- `/home/mqx/workspace/claude-code/vpn/README.md` - Current functionality

## Week 1 Priorities (25 hours total)
1. Issue #61: Installation script (8h) - BLOCKER
2. Issue #58: Secure credentials (4h) - CVSS 7.5
3. Issue #59: Fix log permissions (4h) - CVSS 7.2
4. Issue #60: Race condition tests (6h) - VALIDATION
5. Issue #57: Fix doc inaccuracies (3h) - CONFUSION

Good luck!
