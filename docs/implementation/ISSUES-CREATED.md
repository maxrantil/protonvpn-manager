## Dependencies Between Issues

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)

```
#56 (Dead code)
  ↓
#57 (Documentation) ← depends on #56
  ↓
#58 (Credentials) ← depends on #57 (docs updated)
  ↓
#59 (Logs) ← can run parallel with #58
  ↓
#60 (Tests) ← depends on #58, #59 complete
  ↓
#61 (Installation) ← depends on #58, #59 (new paths)
```

### Week 2 Dependencies

- #68 depends on #56 (dead code removed first)
- #69 can integrate with #62 (connection optimization)

### Week 3 Dependencies

- #70 should complete before #71 (shared utilities available for refactored code)

### Week 4 Dependencies

- #77 must be last (validates all prior fixes)
