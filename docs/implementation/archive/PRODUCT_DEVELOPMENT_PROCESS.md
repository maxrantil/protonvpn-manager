# Product Development Process Framework
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Author:** Claude Code Team
**Approved by:** Doctor Hubert (Pending)

## Executive Summary

This document establishes our standardized product development process combining Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Preliminary Design Reviews (PDRs) into a cohesive workflow. This framework ensures consistent quality, reduces miscommunication, and provides clear decision-making checkpoints throughout the development lifecycle.

---

## 1. Process Overview

### 1.1 Document Hierarchy
```
Product Idea/Request
         ↓
    PRD (Product Requirements Document)
         ↓
    PDR (Preliminary Design Review)
         ↓
    Implementation & Testing
         ↓
    Post-Implementation Review
```

### 1.2 Key Principles
- **User-Centric**: PRDs focus on user needs and business value
- **Technical Excellence**: PDRs ensure sound technical design
- **Agent-Driven**: Multi-agent validation at every stage
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions backed by data and analysis
- **Iterative**: Continuous refinement based on feedback
