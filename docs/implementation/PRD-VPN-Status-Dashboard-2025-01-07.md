# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Product/Feature:** VPN Status Dashboard Enhancement
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Author:** Claude Code Team
**Stakeholders:** Doctor Hubert, VPN Users, System Administrators
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary
We will enhance the existing `vpn status` command to provide a comprehensive, real-time dashboard view of VPN system health, connection status, and performance metrics accessible via both CLI and optional web interface.

## 2. Problem Statement
### 2.1 User Pain Points
- Current `vpn status` provides minimal information (connected/disconnected only)
- No visibility into connection performance, stability, or system health
- No historical data or trending information
- Troubleshooting requires running multiple separate commands
- No proactive alerts for connection issues or performance degradation

### 2.2 Business Impact
- **User Experience**: Improved system transparency and troubleshooting capabilities
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced support requests through better self-service diagnostics
- **System Reliability**: Proactive issue detection and resolution

### 2.3 Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in "connection status unknown" support tickets
- 80% of users can self-diagnose connection issues without support
- Sub-second response time for status dashboard display

## 3. User Stories & Requirements
### 3.1 Primary User Stories
- **As a VPN user, I want to see comprehensive connection status** so that I can verify my connection is working optimally
- **As a VPN user, I want to see performance metrics** so that I can understand if my connection is slow or unstable
- **As a system administrator, I want historical data** so that I can identify patterns and troubleshoot recurring issues
- **As a power user, I want detailed technical information** so that I can perform advanced troubleshooting

### 3.2 Functional Requirements
- Display current connection status with detailed information
- Show real-time performance metrics (speed, latency, stability)
- Provide connection history and uptime statistics
- Display server information and optimal server suggestions
- Show system health indicators (DNS, routing, processes)
- Support multiple output formats (human-readable, JSON, CSV)
- Provide interactive dashboard mode with auto-refresh

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time: <1 second for status display
- Data collection: <5% CPU impact on system performance
- Historical data: Store 30 days of metrics with minimal disk usage
- Accessibility: Support for screen readers and high contrast modes
- Internationalization: Ready for future translation support

## 4. User Experience Design
### 4.1 User Flows
#### Basic Status Check Flow:
1. User runs `vpn status`
2. System displays comprehensive dashboard
3. User can identify issues or confirm healthy operation

#### Advanced Dashboard Flow:
1. User runs `vpn status --dashboard`
2. Interactive dashboard launches with real-time updates
3. User can navigate between different metric views
4. User can export data or access historical information

#### Troubleshooting Flow:
1. User experiences connection issues
2. User runs `vpn status --diagnostic`
3. System provides issue analysis and suggested remediation
4. User follows guided troubleshooting steps
