## üöÄ New Session Startup Prompt

**Copy this 5-10 line prompt for the next session:**

---

I'm continuing work on the VPN Manager project. Previous session completed [Issue #XX/YY - brief description]. All PRs merged, branches clean, on master.

Current focus: [Next priority from list above]

Key context:
- [Critical architectural decision or constraint]
- [Important recent change that affects ongoing work]
- [Any blocker or question that needs addressing]

Please review SESSION_HANDOVER.md and [relevant docs], then [specific action to start with].

---

```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Steps Before Starting New Session

1. **Commit handover document:**
   ```bash
   git add SESSION_HANDOVER.md
   git commit -m "docs: session handover for [date]"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify clean state:**
   ```bash
   git status  # Should show clean working directory
   git branch  # Should show master
   ```

3. **Archive old handover (if exists):**
   - Move previous SESSION_HANDOVER.md to docs/implementation/SESSION-HANDOVER-[old-date].md

4. **Start new session** with the generated startup prompt

## üéì Guidelines

### When to Create Handover
- After completing one or more GitHub issues
- At natural stopping points (end of phase, major feature complete)
- Before extended breaks
- When switching focus areas

### What Makes a Good Handover
- **Complete**: Next session can start immediately without context hunting
- **Concise**: Focus on essential information, not exhaustive details
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps, not just status updates
- **Referenced**: Points to detailed docs rather than duplicating them

### What to Avoid
- Don't duplicate information from other docs
- Don't leave uncommitted changes or dirty working directory
- Don't skip documentation updates "to do later"
- Don't leave temporary planning files scattered in root
