## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Artix Linux or Arch Linux system
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S openvpn curl bc libnotify iproute2 git
  ```
- ProtonVPN account with OpenVPN configuration files

### Automated Installation

**One-command installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxrantil/protonvpn-manager.git
cd protonvpn-manager
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Install required system packages (`openvpn`, `curl`, `bc`, `libnotify`, `iproute2`)
- Set up directory structure
- Create credential template and locations guide
- Make all scripts executable
- Add VPN tools to your PATH
- Run post-installation verification tests

### Manual Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S openvpn curl bc libnotify iproute2 git
   ```

2. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maxrantil/protonvpn-manager.git
   cd protonvpn-manager
   ```

3. **Set up VPN profiles directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p locations/
   # Copy your ProtonVPN .ovpn files to locations/ directory
   ```

4. **Create credentials file**:
   ```bash
   # Create vpn-credentials.txt with your ProtonVPN username and password
   echo "your-username" > vpn-credentials.txt
   echo "your-password" >> vpn-credentials.txt
   chmod 600 vpn-credentials.txt
   ```

5. **Make scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x src/*
   ```

6. **Test installation**:
   ```bash
   ./src/vpn help
   ```

### Uninstallation

To completely remove the VPN Management System:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller will:
- Safely disconnect any active VPN connections
- Back up your configuration files and credentials
- Remove all VPN management components
- Clean up temporary files and caches
- Remove PATH modifications
- Provide options for removing system packages

## Development

This project follows comprehensive development guidelines outlined in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md):

- **Mandatory GitHub issues** before starting work
- **Test-Driven Development** with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- **Pre-commit hooks** for quality assurance
- **Implementation plan tracking** with phase completion

### Workflow

1. **Create GitHub issue** describing the work
2. **Create feature branch** following naming conventions
3. **Setup pre-commit hooks** (if not already done)
4. **Follow TDD practices**: Write failing tests first
5. **Commit frequently** with atomic, logical changes
6. **Update implementation plan** when phases complete

## Contributing

All contributions must follow our established workflow:

1. **GitHub Issues First**: Always create an issue before starting work
2. **TDD Compliance**: Include TDD checklist in every issue and follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
3. **Pre-commit Quality**: All commits must pass comprehensive pre-commit hooks
4. **Professional Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests required

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete development guidelines and [docs/templates/](docs/templates/) for issue templates.
