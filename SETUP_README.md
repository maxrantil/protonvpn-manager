# VPN Setup Guide - Artix/Arch Linux

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete ✅

### What's Been Implemented

1. **System Requirements Analysis** ✅
   - All required packages available in Artix repositories
   - Package manager command mappings documented
   - Init system compatibility assessed

2. **Directory Structure** ✅
   - Created `/home/$USER/workspace/claude-code/vpn/` as main directory
   - Created `locations/` subdirectory for VPN profiles
   - Set proper executable permissions on scripts

3. **Core Scripts** ✅
   - `vpn` - Main CLI interface with colored output and help system
   - `vpn-manager` - Process management, status checking, cleanup
   - `vpn-connector` - Connection handling, server selection

### File Structure
```
/home/$USER/workspace/claude-code/vpn/
├── vpn                 # Main CLI interface (executable)
├── vpn-manager         # Process management (executable)
├── vpn-connector       # Connection handler (executable)
├── credentials.txt     # VPN credentials (username/password)
├── locations/          # VPN profile directory
│   ├── sample_se.ovpn  # Sample Swedish server
│   └── sample_nl.ovpn  # Sample Netherlands server
├── CLAUDE.md           # Project instructions
├── SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md  # Package and compatibility analysis
└── SETUP_README.md     # This file
```

## Dependencies Installed ✅

All required packages are installed:
- `openvpn` 2.6.14-1
- `curl` 8.15.0-1  
- `bc` 1.08.2-1
- `libnotify` 0.8.6-1
- `iproute2` 6.16.0-2

## Testing the Implementation

### Basic Tests

1. **Help System Test**
   ```bash
   ./vpn help
   ```

2. **Status Check**
   ```bash
   ./vpn status
   ```

3. **Profile Listing** 
   ```bash
   ./vpn list
   ```

4. **Dependency Verification**
   ```bash
   ./vpn-connector test
   ```

### Expected Results

- ✅ Scripts are executable and show colored output
- ✅ Help system displays properly formatted menu
- ✅ Status shows "DISCONNECTED" with external IP
- ✅ Profile listing shows sample configurations
- ⚠️  Connection tests will fail (need real VPN credentials/certificates)

## Next Steps for Real Usage

1. **Get Real VPN Credentials**
   - Replace `credentials.txt` with actual VPN username/password
   - Download real .ovpn files from your VPN provider

2. **Add Certificate Files**
   - Place `ca.crt` and `ta.key` files in project directory
   - Update .ovpn files to reference correct certificate paths

3. **Test Connection**
   ```bash
   ./vpn connect se    # Connect to Swedish server
   ./vpn status        # Check connection status
   ./vpn disconnect    # Disconnect
   ```

## Artix/Arch Specific Features

- Uses `pacman` package manager commands
- Compatible with init systems (systemd/OpenRC/runit)
- Integrated with `notify-send` for desktop notifications
- Uses `dwmblocks` status bar integration
- Proper `/tmp` file handling for Arch filesystem

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- **Functionality**: Core VPN management implemented
- **Integration**: Clean Artix/Arch system integration
- **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage docs
- **Testing**: All basic tests pass
- **Dependencies**: All packages available and installed

Phase 1 is **COMPLETE** and ready for Phase 2 development!
