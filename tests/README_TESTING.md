## Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd /home/mqx/workspace/claude-code/vpn/tests
./test_comprehensive_runner.sh
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Security tests only
./test_comprehensive_runner.sh security

# Installation tests only
./test_comprehensive_runner.sh installation

# Service management tests only
./test_comprehensive_runner.sh service
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Security validation
./test_security_validation.sh

# Installation robustness
./test_installation.sh

# Service management
./test_service_management.sh
```

## Test Environment

### Mock Framework Features
- **Non-privileged execution**: Tests system operations without requiring root
- **Systemctl simulation**: Mock systemd operations with state tracking
- **User management mocking**: Simulates user/group creation and management
- **File system operation mocking**: Safe testing of permission changes
- **Network command mocking**: VPN operation simulation

### Test Isolation
- Temporary directories for all test operations
- Mock state management for consistent test results
- Automatic cleanup on test completion
- No modification of production system files

## Security Testing Focus

### Recently Fixed Vulnerabilities
The security test suite specifically validates fixes for:

1. **Command Injection Prevention**
   - Service name validation in protonvpn-service-manager
   - Input sanitization in logging functions
   - Shell metacharacter filtering

2. **Path Traversal Protection**
   - Configuration file path validation in secure-config-manager
   - Realpath canonicalization verification
   - Directory boundary enforcement

3. **Permission Hardening**
   - PID file permission validation
   - Service file ownership verification
   - Directory security enforcement

### Security Test Scenarios
- Malicious input injection attempts
- Path traversal attack simulation
- Log injection prevention testing
- Permission escalation prevention
- Service name spoofing attempts

## Installation Testing Strategy

### Robustness Scenarios
- Complete installation from scratch
- Partial failure recovery procedures
- User and group creation edge cases
- Directory permission validation
- Configuration file generation
- Service file deployment

### Error Recovery Testing
- Installation rollback procedures
- Cleanup verification
- State consistency validation
- Permission restoration

## Service Management Testing

### Lifecycle Testing
- Service start/stop/restart operations
- Individual service management
- Service dependency validation
- Health monitoring verification

### Error Handling
- Invalid service name rejection
- Missing dependency handling
- Permission error simulation
- Resource limit enforcement

## Test Reporting

### Automated Reporting
- Comprehensive test execution logs
- Pass/fail statistics by category
- Failed test identification
- Performance metrics
- Security validation results

### Report Output
Test reports are generated in the project directory with format:
`test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

Reports include:
- Test suite execution summary
- Individual test results
- Failed test details
- Environment information
- Recommendations for fixes

## CI/CD Integration

### Automation Ready
- Exit codes for CI/CD pipeline integration
- Standardized output formats
- Environment variable configuration
- Mock framework for containerized testing

### Recommended CI/CD Usage
```bash
# In CI/CD pipeline
cd tests
./test_comprehensive_runner.sh all
# Exit code 0 = all tests passed
# Exit code 1 = some tests failed
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data Strategy
- Realistic but safe test configurations
- Temporary file management
- State isolation between tests
- Automatic cleanup procedures

### Test Fixtures
- Sample configuration files
- Mock service definitions
- Test user/group data
- Network configuration samples

## Performance Considerations

### Test Execution Time
- Security tests: ~2-3 minutes
- Installation tests: ~3-5 minutes
- Service management tests: ~2-4 minutes
- Complete suite: ~10-15 minutes

### Resource Usage
- Minimal system resource impact
- Temporary directory usage only
- No permanent system modifications
- Safe for production environment testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure test scripts are executable
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Install required system tools
3. **Mock Framework Failures**: Check temporary directory permissions
4. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout values in test configuration

### Debug Mode
Run tests with debug output:
```bash
bash -x ./test_security_validation.sh
```

### Log Analysis
Test logs are available in:
- Individual test output files
- Mock framework state directories
- Comprehensive test reports

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow naming convention: `test_[category].sh`
2. Include test description comments
3. Use consistent logging functions
4. Implement proper cleanup procedures
5. Add to comprehensive test runner

### Test Standards
- All tests must run without root privileges
- Use mock framework for system operations
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Provide clear pass/fail criteria
- Document test scenarios and expected outcomes

## Security Validation Summary

This testing suite specifically addresses the security vulnerabilities recently fixed:

✅ **Command Injection Prevention**: Validated through malicious input testing
✅ **Path Traversal Protection**: Verified through canonicalization testing
✅ **Input Sanitization**: Confirmed through log injection testing
✅ **Permission Hardening**: Validated through file permission testing
✅ **Service Validation**: Confirmed through service name validation testing

The comprehensive testing approach ensures that security fixes are properly implemented and cannot be bypassed through alternative attack vectors.
