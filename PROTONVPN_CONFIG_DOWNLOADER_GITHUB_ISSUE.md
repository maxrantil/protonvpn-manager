## Implementation Notes

### For Development Team:
1. **Security-First Approach:** All development must follow security-enhanced architecture
2. **TDD Mandatory:** No production code without failing tests first (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
3. **Agent Validation:** Regular agent checkpoints throughout development
4. **Documentation:** User guides and technical documentation required
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous benchmarking against targets

### For Doctor Hubert:
- **Weekly Progress Reports:** Security and implementation status updates
- **Agent Validation Checkpoints:** Bi-weekly agent validation during development
- **Security Milestone Reviews:** Phase 0 and Phase 3 security validation required
- **Final Acceptance:** Complete system validation before production deployment

**This issue represents a fully-approved, security-enhanced, production-ready implementation plan for the ProtonVPN Config Auto-Downloader feature. All critical vulnerabilities have been resolved, performance targets are realistic, and the comprehensive TDD approach ensures high-quality delivery.**
