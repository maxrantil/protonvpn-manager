# Session Handover - Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Current Branch**: `master`
**Last Completed**: Issue #47 - Cleanup wildcard pattern fix ✅

## Quick Status

- **Just Completed**: Issue #47 merged via PR #51
  - Fixed overly broad wildcard pattern in full_cleanup()
  - Replaced `rm -f /tmp/vpn_*` with explicit file list
  - Preserves 6 persistent state files (including vpn_simple.log)
  - Removes only 5 temporary files
  - All 3 new tests passing
  - Code Quality: 4.7/5.0 (agent validated)

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: The `full_cleanup()` function used overly broad wildcards that could delete important persistent state files:
```bash
rm -f /tmp/vpn_*.log /tmp/vpn_*.cache /tmp/vpn_*.lock  # TOO BROAD!
```

This would delete service state, connection history, status bar integration, route backups, and the primary log file.

**Solution**: Replaced wildcards with explicit file list + comprehensive documentation:
```bash
# Remove only these 5 temporary files:
rm -f /tmp/vpn_connect.log
rm -f /tmp/vpn_connect.lock
rm -f /tmp/vpn_manager_*.log
rm -f /tmp/vpn_external_ip_cache
rm -f /tmp/vpn_performance.cache

# Preserve these 6 persistent files (documented in comments):
# - vpn_service_state, vpn_last_state, vpn_statusbar_state
# - vpn_statusbar_last_signal, vpn_default_route.backup, vpn_simple.log
```

**Testing**: 3/3 new tests passing
- Preserves 6 persistent state files
- Removes 5 temporary files
- Validates wildcard pattern for manager logs
