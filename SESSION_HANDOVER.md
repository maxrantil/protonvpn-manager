# Session Handover - 2025-10-02

## âœ… Completed This Session

### Branch Cleanup (MAJOR CHANGE)
- **Deleted all old branches**: 13 local + 10 remote branches deleted
- **Renamed `vpn-simple` â†’ `master`**: Simple version is now the main branch
- **Deleted `enterprise-archive`**: Enterprise version completely removed
- **Updated GitHub default branch**: `master` is now the default
- **Clean state**: Only `master` branch remains

**Rationale:** Clean, simple branch structure. Enterprise version removed completely, not just archived.

### Issues Completed
- **Issue #56**: Remove Dead Code and Enterprise Features (on old master, now superseded)
  - Work was done on `enterprise-archive` branch (when it was `master`)
  - Draft PR #78 exists but is now obsolete (targets old master)
  - **Action needed**: Close PR #78 as the simple version is now master

### Code State
- **Current branch**: `master` (formerly `vpn-simple`)
- **Line count**: ~1,924 lines (6 components)
- **Status**: Clean, simplified, no enterprise code
- **Recent fixes**: Issues #44, #45, #46, #47 completed on this branch

---

## ðŸ”œ Next Session Priorities

### IMPORTANT: Reassess Week 1 P0 Issues

The Week 1 P0 issues (Issue #56-#61) were created for the **enterprise-archive** branch based on its codebase state. Now that `master` is the simplified version, we need to:

1. **Re-evaluate each issue** against the current `master` codebase
2. **Close inapplicable issues** (if the problem doesn't exist in the simple version)
3. **Create new issues** if problems exist but need different solutions
4. **Update roadmap** to reflect the simplified codebase

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Close PR #78** - Dead code removal (obsolete, targets old master)
2. **Audit Issue #56-#61** - Check if they apply to current master
3. **Run line count** - Get accurate metrics for simple version
4. **Review ROADMAP** - Update for simplified codebase
5. **Start fresh** with appropriate issues for master branch

### Issues to Review
- Issue #56: Dead code removal - **LIKELY NOT NEEDED** (simple version has no enterprise code)
- Issue #57: Documentation fixes - **NEEDED** (docs still reference old structure)
- Issue #58: Credential storage - **CHECK** (verify if issue exists in simple version)
- Issue #59: Log file permissions - **CHECK** (verify if issue exists in simple version)
- Issue #60: TOCTOU tests - **DEPENDS** (check if TOCTOU fix from Issue #46 has tests)
- Issue #61: Installation - **NEEDED** (deployment still needs work)

---

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation References
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated branch strategy (lines 45-50)
- **Branch structure**: Now clear and simple

---

## ðŸš€ New Session Startup Prompt

**Copy this for the next session:**

```
Complete branch cleanup finished. Only `master` branch remains - all old branches deleted.

**Critical:** Week 1 P0 Issues (#56-#61) were created for the old enterprise codebase. They may not apply to the current simplified master branch.

**Start by:**
1. Close PR #78 (dead code removal - obsolete, targets deleted branch)
2. Run `wc -l src/*` to get accurate line counts
3. Review Issues #56-#61 against current master codebase
4. Close inapplicable issues or update descriptions
5. Update roadmap to reflect simplified codebase

Current master state:
- 6 core components (~1,924 lines)
- Issues #44, #45, #46, #47 already fixed
- No enterprise code or old branches
- Clean, simple repository structure

Reference: Review ROADMAP-2025-10.md and verify issues against actual codebase.
```
