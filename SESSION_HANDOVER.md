# Session Handover - 2025-10-02

## âœ… Completed This Session

### Branch Restructure (MAJOR CHANGE)
- **Renamed `master` â†’ `enterprise-archive`**: Enterprise version archived
- **Renamed `vpn-simple` â†’ `master`**: Simple version is now the main branch
- **Updated GitHub default branch**: `master` is now the default
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Branch strategy documentation updated

**Rationale:** The simplified version is the active development branch. The enterprise version is preserved for reference but no longer actively developed.

### Issues Completed
- **Issue #56**: Remove Dead Code and Enterprise Features (on old master, now superseded)
  - Work was done on `enterprise-archive` branch (when it was `master`)
  - Draft PR #78 exists but is now obsolete (targets old master)
  - **Action needed**: Close PR #78 as the simple version is now master

### Code State
- **Current branch**: `master` (formerly `vpn-simple`)
- **Line count**: ~1,924 lines (6 components)
- **Status**: Clean, simplified, no enterprise code
- **Recent fixes**: Issues #44, #45, #46, #47 completed on this branch

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

### Active Branch
- **master** (simplified version)
  - Clean architecture (6 core components)
  - No enterprise features
  - All recent bug fixes applied
  - Ready for new development

### Archived Branch
- **enterprise-archive** (old master)
  - Contains enterprise features
  - Preserved for reference only
  - No active development

### Code Metrics
- **Current (master)**: ~1,924 lines (6 components)
- **Archived (enterprise-archive)**: ~2,996 lines (6 components + enterprise code)
- **Reduction**: Simple version is 36% smaller

## ðŸ“Š Project Health

### Test Coverage
- All tests passing on master âœ…
- Test suite complete and functional
- No enterprise test dependencies

### Branch Status
- Current branch: `master` âœ…
- Working directory: Clean âœ…
- Remote sync: Updated âœ…
- Default branch: `master` âœ…

### Clean Slate
- No dead code

## ðŸ”œ Next Session Priorities

### IMPORTANT: Reassess Week 1 P0 Issues

The Week 1 P0 issues (Issue #56-#61) were created for the **enterprise-archive** branch based on its codebase state. Now that `master` is the simplified version, we need to:

1. **Re-evaluate each issue** against the current `master` codebase
2. **Close inapplicable issues** (if the problem doesn't exist in the simple version)
3. **Create new issues** if problems exist but need different solutions
4. **Update roadmap** to reflect the simplified codebase

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Close PR #78** - Dead code removal (obsolete, targets old master)
2. **Audit Issue #56-#61** - Check if they apply to current master
3. **Run line count** - Get accurate metrics for simple version
4. **Review ROADMAP** - Update for simplified codebase
5. **Start fresh** with appropriate issues for master branch

### Issues to Review
- Issue #56: Dead code removal - **LIKELY NOT NEEDED** (simple version has no enterprise code)
- Issue #57: Documentation fixes - **NEEDED** (docs still reference old structure)
- Issue #58: Credential storage - **CHECK** (verify if issue exists in simple version)
- Issue #59: Log file permissions - **CHECK** (verify if issue exists in simple version)
- Issue #60: TOCTOU tests - **DEPENDS** (check if TOCTOU fix from Issue #46 has tests)
- Issue #61: Installation - **NEEDED** (deployment still needs work)

---

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation References
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated branch strategy (lines 45-50)
- **Branch structure**: Now clear and simple

---

## ðŸš€ New Session Startup Prompt

**Copy this for the next session:**

```
Branch restructure complete. `vpn-simple` is now `master` (default branch). Enterprise version archived as `enterprise-archive`.

**Critical:** Week 1 P0 Issues (#56-#61) were created for enterprise-archive codebase. They may not apply to the simplified master branch.

**Start by:**
1. Close PR #78 (dead code removal - obsolete)
2. Run `wc -l src/*` to get accurate line counts for current master
3. Review Issues #56-#61 against current master codebase
4. Close inapplicable issues or update descriptions
5. Update roadmap if needed

Current master state:
- 6 core components (~1,924 lines)
- Issues #44, #45, #46, #47 already fixed
- No enterprise code
- Clean slate for development

Reference: Review ROADMAP-2025-10.md and verify issues against actual codebase.
```

**Next session focus:** Audit Week 1 issues against simplified codebase
**Major change:** Branch restructure complete - simple version is now master
