# Session Handover - 2025-10-02

## âœ… Completed This Session

### Branch Cleanup (MAJOR CHANGE)
- **Deleted all old branches**: 13 local + 10 remote branches deleted
- **Renamed `vpn-simple` â†’ `master`**: Simple version is now the main branch
- **Deleted `enterprise-archive`**: Enterprise version completely removed
- **Updated GitHub default branch**: `master` is now the default
- **Clean state**: Only `master` branch remains

**Rationale:** Clean, simple branch structure. Enterprise version removed completely, not just archived.

### Documentation Updates

## ðŸ”œ Next Session Priorities

### CRITICAL: Reassess Week 1 P0 Issues

**Important Context:**
- Week 1 P0 Issues (#56-#61) were created based on 8-agent analysis of the OLD enterprise codebase (~2,996 lines)
- Current master is the SIMPLIFIED version (~1,924 lines) with NO enterprise code
- Issues #44, #45, #46, #47 already completed on simplified version
- PR #78 (Issue #56 work) targets the deleted enterprise-archive branch

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Close PR #78** - Dead code removal (obsolete, targets deleted enterprise-archive)
2. **Audit Issues #56-#61** - Verify if problems exist in simplified master
3. **Run metrics** - Get accurate line counts: `wc -l src/*`
4. **Review ROADMAP** - Update for simplified codebase reality
5. **Close or update issues** - Only keep issues that apply to current master

### Issues to Review (Week 1 P0)

| Issue | Title | Status to Verify |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| #56 | Remove dead code & enterprise features | **LIKELY OBSOLETE** - no enterprise code in master |
| #57 | Fix documentation inaccuracies | **NEEDED** - docs reference old structure |
| #58 | Secure credential storage (CVSS 7.5) | **CHECK** - verify if exists in master |
| #59 | Fix world-writable log files (CVSS 7.2) | **CHECK** - verify if exists in master |
| #60 | Add TOCTOU test coverage | **VERIFY** - Issue #46 fix may have tests |
| #61 | Create functional installation | **NEEDED** - deployment still broken |

### Expected Outcomes

After audit, likely scenario:
- Close #56 (no enterprise code to remove)
- Keep #57 (docs need fixing)
- Possibly close #58, #59 (may already be fixed or not applicable)
- Update #60 (check actual test coverage)
- Keep #61 (installation definitely needs work)

---

## ðŸ“š Key Documentation References
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated branch strategy (lines 45-50) - only master exists
- **ROADMAP-2025-10.md**: Created for enterprise codebase - needs review/update

---

## ðŸš€ New Session Startup Prompt

**Copy this for the next session:**

```
VPN Manager project - branch cleanup complete. Only `master` branch exists now (enterprise version deleted).

**Critical task:** Audit Week 1 P0 Issues (#56-#61) - they were created for the OLD enterprise codebase (2,996 lines) but current master is the SIMPLIFIED version (1,924 lines).

**Start by:**
1. Close PR #78 (obsolete - targets deleted enterprise-archive branch)
2. Run `wc -l src/*` to verify current line counts
3. Check each issue #56-#61 against ACTUAL master codebase
4. Close inapplicable issues (like #56 - no enterprise code exists)
5. Update remaining issues with correct context

**Context:**
- Master is simplified version (Issues #44-47 already fixed here)
- No enterprise code exists
- ROADMAP-2025-10.md may need updating for simplified reality
- Clean slate: 6 components, ~1,924 lines, no technical debt from enterprise version

**Goal:** Determine which issues actually apply to the current simplified codebase.
```
