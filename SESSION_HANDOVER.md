# Session Handover - Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Current Branch**: `master`
**Last Completed**: Issue #44 - Logging system initialization ✅

## Quick Status

- **Just Completed**: Issue #44 merged via PR #50
  - Fixed logging system - log file now initialized properly
  - Added 666 permissions for multi-user /tmp access
  - Permission repair for existing files (idempotent)
  - All 6 tests passing
  - Code Quality: 3.5/5.0

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Logging system from Enhancement #1 didn't work because `/tmp/vpn_simple.log` was never created.

**Solution**: Added `initialize_log_file()` function to both `vpn-manager` and `vpn-connector`:
- Creates log file with proper permissions on first use
- Repairs permissions on existing files (idempotent)
- Verifies chmod succeeded (no silent failures)

**Testing**: 6/6 tests passing
- Log file creation
- Correct permissions (666)
- Permission repair
- Logging works
- Idempotent function
- Fallback mechanism
